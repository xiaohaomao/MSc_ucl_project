The introduction of generating sample and implementing Multi-state modelling


Sample_x or Sample_x_x are Mablab file to generate simulated data,
the .R file be used to model the corresponding simulated data.


For example:

Sample_10_11: generated Sample 10 or Sample 11 by changing the settings 

Chi2_Square_sample_12_13.r:  file of modelling the sample 12 or 13 as a Multi-state model;
user need  to change the address as varying of Sample's address.
